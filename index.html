                <h3>World-Class Professional Web Developer</h3>
                <p>Hi! I’m a web developer and 
                I love all things tech. When I’m not knee-deep in code, I’m
                probably reading up on the latest development trends or
                practicing my sketching (or both).
                <p>I got my start in technology as a self-taught coder, and since then I’ve never looked back. I specialize in front-end development, but I have a little bit of experience with everything from coding to QA to project management.</p>
                I’m always looking for new challenges and opportunities, and I’m excited to see what the future holds for me in the world of tech. Thanks for reading!</P>
